I am specifically interested in applying these methods to Autism Spectrum Disorder in the hopes of discovering meaningful subtypes that can improve supports, care and understanding of ASD. I am also interested in improving the construction of similarity networks and identifying methods of reducing the noise in unsupervised clustering on networks. This work is supervised by Ian Simpson and funded in part by the EPSRC. My other research interests include graph learning, incorporation of ontology information and the wider area of network science."
