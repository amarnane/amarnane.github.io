Following the [basic tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/computations/vscode.html) from Quarto.

## NumPy

```{python}
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
a
```

## Matplotlib

```{python}
#| label: fig-limits
#| fig-cap: "Errorbar limit selector"

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure()
x = np.arange(10)
y = 2.5 * np.sin(x / 20 * np.pi)
yerr = np.linspace(0.05, 0.2, 10)

plt.errorbar(x, y + 3, yerr=yerr, label='both limits (default)')
plt.errorbar(x, y + 2, yerr=yerr, uplims=True, label='uplims=True')
plt.errorbar(x, y + 1, yerr=yerr, uplims=True, lolims=True,
             label='uplims=True, lolims=True')

upperlimits = [True, False] * 5
lowerlimits = [False, True] * 5
plt.errorbar(x, y, yerr=yerr, uplims=upperlimits, lolims=lowerlimits,
             label='subsets of uplims and lolims')

plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.show(fig)
```

## Plotly

### without options
```{python}
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
gapminder = px.data.gapminder()
gapminder2007 = gapminder.query("year == 2007")
fig = px.scatter(gapminder2007, 
                 x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp", color="continent", 
                 size="pop", size_max=60,
                 hover_name="country")
fig.show()
```


### With Options
```{python}
#| label: fig-gapminder
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy and GDP"
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "Gapminder: 1957"
#|   - "Gapminder: 2007"
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page

import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
gapminder = px.data.gapminder()
gapminder2007 = gapminder.query("year == 2007")
fig = px.scatter(gapminder2007, 
                 x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp", color="continent", 
                 size="pop", size_max=60,
                 hover_name="country")
fig.show()

gapminder1957 = gapminder.query("year == 1957")
fig = px.scatter(gapminder1957, 
                 x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp", color="continent", 
                 size="pop", size_max=60,
                 hover_name="country")
fig.show()
```


## From Notebooks
It is simple to embed plots from precomputed notebooks and include a link.

```
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-scatter >}}
```
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-scatter >}}
```
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-marginal >}}
```
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#fig-bill-marginal >}}
You can also include the code by specifying `echo=true` in the call.
```
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#species-counts echo=true >}}
```
{{< embed penguins.ipynb#species-counts echo=true >}}

You can control how the link to the notebook appears in the title metadata [^4]:
```
notebook-view:
  - notebook: penguins.ipynb
    title: "Plots and Computations"
```

[^4]: See the [notebook embedding tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html) for more info


## rendering code
There are a number of ways to control the rendering of code. For example, if you have a notebook with some code that takes a long time to run you won't want to recompute it everytime you change formatting. There are many options to control this behaviour. [^2] 

```
execute:
  freeze: true 
```

[^2]: see the [python tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html) for a more in depth explanation

## callout blocks
Quarto has nice control for adding note blocks. There are five formats [^5]
- note
- warning
- important
- tip 
- caution

[^5]: See [their tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html) for a more in depth explanation


```
::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title. See [their tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html) for a more in depth explanation
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.

## Cross referencing

```{python}
#| label: fig-line-plot
#| fig-cap: "A line plot "

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
plt.show()
```


This is a cross reference to our figure @fig-line-plot with `@fig-line-plot`. We can also reference the matplotlib figure above @fig-limits `@fig-limits`. 

:::{.callout-note}
You must start your label with `fig-` e.g. `fig-line-plot` for the cross reference to work.
:::

## Citations
You can include citations by including a bibliography. 

For example, Antoine et al produced some sick work [@alain-2022].

Add a path to your bibliography in the title metadata
```
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

You can customise citation style and more.[^1]
```
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
csl: nature.csl
---
``` 
:::{.callout-note}
You can download csl files from the [CSL repo](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles). nature.csl was taken from [here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/nature.csl) (there are so many I had to search to get it.)
:::

[^1]: Footnotes are also possible. For more guidance see the [quarto tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html)

Citation can also be placed in the margin by adding
```
citation-location: margin
```

## Equations
We can also write equations. 

They can be placed inline $\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$ `$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$`.

They can be placed centrally.
```
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
```

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$


But they can also be placed in the margin
```
::: {.column-margin}
We know from *the first fundamental theorem of calculus* that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:


$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
