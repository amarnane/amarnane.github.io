:::{#about-section}

# Welcome!
I am a PhD student in the [Data Science CDT](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. My research is on unsupervised clustering of biomedical data through the construction of similarity networks. I am specifically interested in applying these methods to Autism Spectrum Disorder. The hope is to discover meaningful subtypes that can improve supports, care and understanding of ASD. 

I am also interested in improving the construction of similarity networks and identifying methods of reducing the noise in unsupervised clustering on networks. This work is supervised by [Ian Simpson](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/) and funded in part by the [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/). My other research interests include graph learning, extacting and incorporating information from biomedical ontologies and the wider area of network science.
