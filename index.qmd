:::{#about-section}

# Welcome!
I am a Data Scientist based in Cork, Ireland. I am currently working for [Applied Intelligence Analytics Ltd](https://www.aianalytics.ie/). My primary work involves AI research and development on EU Defence projects with topics ranging from maritime surveillence to sensor fusion. A particular focus of my current work is the analysis of multi-variate time series.

## PhD @ University of Edinburgh
I was previously a PhD student in the [Data Science CDT](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. My research was on unsupervised clustering of biomedical data through the construction of similarity networks. In my thesis, I explored and evaluated the current approaches used to construct similarity networks. I showcased the power of network construction methods for community detection in identifying subtypes of Cancer and Autism Spectrum Disorder. I highlighted the ability of these methods to incorporate incomplete multi-modal data.  See [here for my PhD Thesis](thesis.qmd)


This work was supervised by [Ian Simpson](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/ian-simpson) and funded in part by the [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/). My other research interests include graph learning, extacting and incorporating information from biomedical ontologies and the wider area of network science.

## Simnetpy
As part of my research, I developed a package for the analysis of similarity networks. This can be found at [https://amarnane.github.io/simnetpy/](https://amarnane.github.io/simnetpy/). With this package you can generate complex synthetic data, construct similarity networks and perform unsupervised clustering. All included algorithms expect the number of clusters is *unknown*.
