# Welcome!
I am a PhD student in the [Data Science CDT](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. My research is focused on the use of similarity networks and unsupervised clustering for biomedical data. Running, bouldering and board games keep me sane when not banging my head against the monitor!

## Welcome!

::: {.column-page-inset}
::: {.column-page-inset-left}

I am a PhD student in the [Data Science CDT](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. My research is on unsupervised clustering of biomedical data through the construction of similarity networks. I am specifically interested in applying these methods to Autism Spectrum Disorder in the hopes of discovering meaningful subtypes that can improve supports, care and understanding of ASD. I am also interested in improving the construction of similarity networks and identifying methods of reducing the noise in unsupervised clustering on networks. This work is supervised by [Ian Simpson](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/) and funded in part by the [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/). My other research interests include graph learning, incorporation of ontology information and the wider area of network science.
