## About

I am a PhD student in the [Data Science CDT](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. My research is on unsupervised clustering of biomedical data through the construction of similarity networks. I am specifically interested in applying these methods to Autism Spectrum Disorder in the hopes of discovering meaningful subtypes that can improve supports, care and understanding of ASD. I am also interested in improving the construction of similarity networks and identifying methods of reducing the noise in unsupervised clustering on networks. This work is supervised by [Ian Simpson](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/) and funded in part by the [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/). My other research interests include graph learning, incorporation of ontology information and the wider area of network science.


## Teaching

I have experience with tutor, demonstror and marker roles while studying both in Cork and in Edinburgh. Courses I have taught include [Probabilistic Modelling and Reasoning](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pmr/18-19/), [Computer Programming for Speech and Language Processing](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/21-22/dpt/cxlasc11096.htm), [AM3051 Tensor and Vector Methods](https://ucc-ie-public.courseleaf.com/modules/), [ML Base](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2019/support_roles.html#ml-base-tutors) (drop in style sessions to assist students with questions on machine learning)
